# Module 2 Challenge
# Refactoring VBA Code for Stocks Analysis

## Overview of Project: The stated goal for this challenge is to most efficiently capture stock ticker data for our client, allowing him to recommend the best stok or basket of stocks for investment. The underpinning idea of this project is to reformat existing code evaluating these stock tickers in an effort to make improvements on the efficiency of the code. The initial stock ticker analysis macro had to run through all rows and columns of the stock data many times and the goal for our refactored code was to require only one pass through the data set, using arrays to store our eventual output values. 

 

## Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

### Stock Performance Comparison: 2017 vs. 2018

Overall, these twelve stocks performed much better in 2017 than in 2018. The average annual return for this group of stocks in 2017 was about 67%, while the average annual return for this group of stocks in 2018 was -8.51%. 

Here is a bar graph showing the annual return for each stock in 2017 and 2018:

As we can see here, only one stock "RUN" posted an overall annual return in 2018 that surpassed its number for 2017 while remaining positive both years. Another ticker of note is "FLSR," performing worse in 2017 in terms of its annual return, while its returns for both years remained positive. Outside of these two tickers, the other ten all saw negative returns in 2018, indicating a tough year for this particular basket of stocks. A small bright spot might be TERP, whose returns, while negative for both 2017 and 2018, posted less of a loss in 2018, indicating a possible turnaround.
